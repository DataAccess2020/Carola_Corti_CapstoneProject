# Abstract

This project aims at collecting information about the discourse above smart cities. I will focus on India's specific case, inspecting whether the debate related to smart cities' policies' implementation in such country develops positively or negatively, what topics are the mostly discussed and which are the most problematic issues related to it.

The research will be composed of two main parts. In the first, I will provide sentiment and topic analyses processing a corpus of articles about India's smart cities development. In the second part, by interacting with the Twitter and Google Maps APIs, I will download via geographical selection the latest 2000 tweets written in India, containing the words "smart cities" and "Covid-19" . The analyses will be run, on the one hand, in order to identify the main debated topics within the smart cities broader narratives; on the other hand, to capture the overall sentiment among the texts to draw a better picture of how smart cities are perceived and what can be addressed as a criticisms or advantage in the implementation of such urban planning decisions in the perspective of both the governmental and its citizens point of view, especially in light of the Covid-19 health emergency and the known and highly debated overcrowding, poverty and diseased conditions that are common to many Indian metropolitan areas.

# Introduction

According to the definition provided by the European Commission, "smart cities" are places where traditional networks and services are made more efficient with the use of digital and telecommunication technologies for the benefit of its inhabitants and business. Smart metropolitan areas would do so by going beyond the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in order to provide better resources while using less emissions. The implementation of policies aimed at providing efficient urban transport networks, upgraded water supplies, waste disposal facilities, electricity and heating technologies to let all goods reach each building and each societal stratus in the urban area, are at the heart of smart cities' goals. In other words, the underlining aim of adopting such policies is ought to implement interactive and responsive city administration strategies, guaranteeing safer public spaces and taking into consideration the needs of the whole population.

Rob Kitchin, one of the leading scholars interested in the debate about smart cities, professor and researcher of human geography at the National Institute of Regional and Spatial Analysis at Maynooth University of Ireland, states that definition of Smart City has to take into account two important aspects. On the one side, he defines as "smart" a urban context in which *everyware* technologies (Greenfield, 2006) are massively implemented. By using this term, he refers to the massively used ubiquitous computing practices, defined by human-machine interactions extended on several levels, capable of connecting physical and digital space through the continuous collection and management of the data citizens generate interacting with the surrounding material space. On the other hand, he sheds light on the importance of understanding the relationship that occurs between citizens and the technologies they interact with. The implementation of Information Communication Technologies does not in fact constitute, in itself, a necessary and sufficient condition for a city to be defined as really intelligent; it rather is the way in which datafied interactions are used and perceived by who are supposed to be its end-users, to define whether a city is "smart" or not.

While it is easy to build city planning projects enthusiastically focusing on the implementation of highly advanced technologies in many fields, it is less immediate to inspect urban fabrics taking into account both the physical urban environment ( i.e. its elements, materials, form, scales, density and networks), and the psychological, socio-cultural, ecological, managerial and economic structures of metropolitan areas.

It is taking into account this last consideration, that the debate around Smart City initiatives is more and more heated in developing countries where the ideal prerequisites to advance such policies are more likely to lack. These research focuses on the most prominent example In the Global South: India. The country is a key actor in implementing national-level smart city programs. The clearest example is provided by the "Smart Cities Mission", which was launched in 2015 as a urban renewal and retrofitting program by Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of the Government of India, with the aim to develop smart cities across the country, making them citizen friendly and sustainable. The plan initially included 100 cities, planning projects to be realized between 2019 and 2023.

# URBANET: scraping and analyzing articles about smart urban planning in India

In this first session I will provide a textual analysis of the articles about smart cities in India collected in the [URBANET](https://www.urbanet.info/) web page. This digital blog fosters international dialogue on development activities worldwide and shares expertise in the areas of municipal and local governance, sustainable urban development and decentralization. Addressing international experts and working with multiple renowned authors from around the globe, the blog is supported and implemented by GIZ's Sector Project "Urbanization, Municipal and Urban Development" on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). The articles revolve around governance and finance issues, basic infrastructure, housing, green and smart development and global urban debates.

It is in consideration of these contents that the articles collected in the site session dedicated to India (available at [this link](https://www.urbanet.info/tag/india/)), were considered as a good starting point for my analysis. The following sessions will describe both the whole scraping process I performed to access the textual data I needed before running the subsequent text mining analyses.

## /robots.txt file inspection

To check whether the website's rules permitted to perform web scraping on that page, i checked the robots.txt file. As a result, the following lines of code are shown:

![](images/ROBOTSTXT.png){width="276"}

The website shows it instructions to web robots by using the Robots Exclusion Protocol. The first line tells us this section applies to all robots; the second tells no robot can crawl the "/wp-admin/" page, namely the control dashboard of the entire WordPress website, while the last one tells the website is allowed to be crawled.

## Selecting CSS paths from the DOM structure via Selector Gadget

After having inspected the /robots.txt file, I've selected the parts of the web page I need to take into account to build the corpus on which I'll perform text analytics. I'll use selector Gadget, which will help me generating by a simple point-click operation the CSS tag I need to extract the elements I'm looking for.
