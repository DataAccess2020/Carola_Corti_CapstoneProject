# Abstract

This project aims at collecting information about the discourse above smart cities. I will focus on India's specific case, inspecting whether the debate related to smart cities' policies' implementation in such country develops positively or negatively, what topics are the mostly discussed and which are the most problematic issues related to it.

The research will be composed of two main parts. In the first, I will provide sentiment and topic analyses processing a corpus of articles about India's smart cities development. In the second part, by interacting with the Twitter and Google Maps APIs, I will download via geographical selection the latest 2000 tweets written in India, containing the words "smart cities" and "Covid-19" . The analyses will be run, on the one hand, in order to identify the main debated topics within the smart cities broader narratives; on the other hand, to capture the overall sentiment among the texts to draw a better picture of how smart cities are perceived and what can be addressed as a criticisms or advantage in the implementation of such urban planning decisions in the perspective of both the governmental and its citizens point of view, especially in light of the Covid-19 health emergency and the known and highly debated overcrowding, poverty and diseased conditions that are common to many Indian metropolitan areas.

# URBANET: scraping and analyzing articles about smart urban planning in India

In this first session I will provide a textual analysis of the articles about smart cities in India collected in the [URBANET](https://www.urbanet.info/) web page. This digital blog fosters international dialogue on development activities worldwide and shares expertise in the areas of municipal and local governance, sustainable urban development and decentralization. Addressing international experts and working with multiple renowned authors from around the globe, the blog is supported and implemented by GIZ's Sector Project "Urbanization, Municipal and Urban Development" on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). The articles revolve around governance and finance issues, basic infrastructure, housing, green and smart development and global urban debates.

It is in consideration of these contents that the articles collected in the site session dedicated to India (available at [this link](https://www.urbanet.info/tag/india/)), were considered as a good starting point for my analysis. The following sessions will describe both the whole scraping process I performed to access the textual data I needed before running the subsequent text mining analyses.

## /robots.txt file inspection

To check whether the website's rules permitted to perform web scraping on that page, i checked the robots.txt file. As a result, the following lines of code are shown:

![](images/ROBOTSTXT.png){width="276"}

The website shows it instructions to web robots by using the Robots Exclusion Protocol. The first line tells us this section applies to all robots; the second tells no robot can crawl the "/wp-admin/" page, namely the control dashboard of the entire WordPress website, while the last one tells the website is allowed to be crawled.

## Selecting CSS paths from the DOM structure via Selector Gadget

After having inspected the /robots.txt file, I've selected the parts of the web page I need to take into account to build the corpus on which I'll perform text analytics. I'll use selector Gadget, which will help me generating by a simple point-click operation the CSS tag I need to extract the elements I'm looking for.
