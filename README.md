**Smart cities in India: sketching public opinion trends on smart urban planning policies**

This research is aimed at drawing an overall picture of how smart cities are perceived in its stakeholders' opinion and what can be addressed as a criticisms or advantage in the implementation of such urban planning decisions. I will consider, as a case study, India's smart cities. Both corporate/governmental and the private citizens' points will be taken into account: this will be done by analyzing a series of Financial Express' articles about smart cities, comparing them to a corpus of tweets written in the country about this topic.
